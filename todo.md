- [ ] consider making the model return logits instead of the PretrainedModel output
  - [ ] in report, justify the use of PreTrainedModel loss if not. It uses CrossEntropy internally, etc. 
- [ ] any way to avoid all the `# type: ignore`'s?
- [ ] generalise to allow `facebook/opt-125m`
- [ ] correct typos in report 
- [ ] stop saving model locally, let hf cache handle it. Cleaner.
